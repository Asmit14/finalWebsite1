  <strong>1. What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) </strong>  <br>
-> An application layer protocol used to transmit 'hypermedia' documents like HTML. <br>
<br>
<strong>2. Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol? </strong><br>
-> It follows a client-server model and is a stateless protocol which means it does not retain any data in between requests from the client side.  <br>
<br>
<strong>3. Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP</strong> <br>

-> (1)The client establishes the connection through either a TCP connection or any other suitable transport layer. <br>
   (2)The client sends the request to the server. <br>
   (3)The server processes and sends back the answer while also providing a status code as well as any relevant data. <br>
<br>
<strong>4. Describe the parameters on a get and post request. </strong><br>
-> GET : The parameter name and it's associated values are present. <br>
   POST: The keys and values are encoded in a data structure and non alphanumeric characters are percent encoded.<br>
<br>
<strong>5. What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate?</strong> <br>
-> Response status codes indicate whether requests are successfully completed or not. <br>
   HTTP status code 200 - the request has succeeded. <br>
   HTTP status code 404 - the server was unable to find the requested resource. <br>
 <br>

<strong>6. What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.</strong> <br>
-> It is data sent by the server to a client's web browser such that the browser may store it and send it back with rewuests to the same server at a later point in time. <br>
the option to stay signed in or to remember passwords during login to online services are the result of cookies. <br>
<br>
<strong>7. Why are cookies a security issue?</strong> <br>
-> They can be read an modified/edited by those who have access to a clients hard disk in spite of the security measures taken to ensure cookies cannot fall into the hands of <br>
third parties and only go to the intended recipient. <br>
<br>
<strong>8. Describe session hijacking and XSS</strong> <br>
-> XSS, referring to cross site scripting is a security gap which allows an attacker to inject malicious client side code into the website. This code is later executed by the <br>
victims of the attack and allow the attacker to get past security/access controls and subsequently impersonate users. <br>
Session Hijacking relies on an attackers knowledge of a users session cookie. Once a user is authenticated on the server side, the attacker is capable of using the session cookie to <br>
hijack the session on their own browser. <br>
<br>

<strong>9. Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF)-></strong> <br>
-> An attacker can use XSS to launch a CSRF attack. The attacker causes a user's browser to send a request to the website without the user's own knowledge. <br>
<br>

<strong>10. What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS?</strong> <br>
-> They are requests for resources belonging to a different domain than the domain of the resource that makes the request. <br>
CSS Shapes from images makes such requests. <br>
